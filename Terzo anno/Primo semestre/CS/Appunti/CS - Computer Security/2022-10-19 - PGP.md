# PGP - Pretty Good Privacy
Provide various services:
	- digital signature
	- message encryption
	- compression
	- email compatibility
	- segmentation (for message range limit)

GPG is an open source implementation of PGP

## Data protection
Different kind:
- in-transit (while transmitting)
- at-rest (on disk)
- in-use (not stored, but present in main memory, used by a sw (e.g. a key for encryption))

Note that PGP holds two key rings, that are a structure stored on disk with possible keys to sign the message; one is for private keys, the other for public ones. 
So key rings are protected with a symmetric key (that is requested to the user, not stored!), in particular a passphrase.
For encrypt the signature + message PGP use a session key, that is pseudo random generated.
(See PGP - Message Generation (Sender))

**Important problem** - key-rings integrity: if a key ring (protection at rest) is altered, an attacker can insert his public key, that will encrypt next session key. Note that PGP does not address this kind of problem.
